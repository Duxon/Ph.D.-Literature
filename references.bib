  abstract  = "Publisher Summary Ptychography is a nonholographic solution of
               the phase problem. It is a method for calculating the phase
               relationships among different parts of a scattered wave
               disturbance in a situation where only the magnitude (intensity
               or flux) of the wave can be physically measured. Its usefulness
               lies in its ability (like holography) to obtain images without
               the use of lenses, and hence to lead to resolution improvements
               and access to properties of the scattering medium that cannot be
               easily obtained from conventional imaging methods. The chapter
               discusses ptychography in the context of other phase-retrieval
               methods in both historical and conceptual terms. In an original
               and oblique approach to the phase problem, it was Hoppe who
               proposed the first version of the particular solution to the
               phase problem. The word ``ptychography'' was introduced to
               suggest a solution to the phase problem using the convolution
               theorem, or rather the ``folding'' of diffraction orders into
               one another via the convolution of the Fourier transform of a
               localized aperture or illumination function in the object plane.
               Apart from computers, the two most important experimental issues
               that affect ptychography, relate to the degree of coherence in
               the illuminating beam and the detector efficiency and dynamic
               range.",

              difficulty commonly encountered in diffractive imaging is the
              large dynamic range of the diffraction data. Here we report a
              novel ptychographic experiment using a randomly phased X-ray

              of this method for soft X-ray spectromicroscopy, which can
              readily provide chemical sensitivity without the need for optical
              refocusing. In particular, the phase signal is in perfect
              registration with the modulus signal and provides complementary
