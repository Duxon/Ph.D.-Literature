  abstract  = "Publisher Summary Ptychography is a nonholographic solution of
               the phase problem. It is a method for calculating the phase
               relationships among different parts of a scattered wave
               disturbance in a situation where only the magnitude (intensity
               or flux) of the wave can be physically measured. Its usefulness
               lies in its ability (like holography) to obtain images without
               the use of lenses, and hence to lead to resolution improvements
               and access to properties of the scattering medium that cannot be
               easily obtained from conventional imaging methods. The chapter
               discusses ptychography in the context of other phase-retrieval
               methods in both historical and conceptual terms. In an original
               and oblique approach to the phase problem, it was Hoppe who
               proposed the first version of the particular solution to the
               phase problem. The word ``ptychography'' was introduced to
               suggest a solution to the phase problem using the convolution
               theorem, or rather the ``folding'' of diffraction orders into
               one another via the convolution of the Fourier transform of a
               localized aperture or illumination function in the object plane.
               Apart from computers, the two most important experimental issues
               that affect ptychography, relate to the degree of coherence in
               the illuminating beam and the detector efficiency and dynamic
               range.",

               over and comprehensive characterization of wave fields. As
               reflected in its name, coherent diffractive imaging relies on
               high coherence when reconstructing highly resolved images from
               diffraction intensities alone without the need for image-forming
               lenses1,2,3. Fully coherent light can be described adequately by
               a single pure state. Yet partial coherence and imperfect
               detection often need to be accounted for, requiring statistical
               optics or the superposition of states4,5. Furthermore, the
               dynamics of samples are increasingly the very objectives of
               experiments6. Here we provide a general analytic approach to the
               characterization of diffractive imaging systems that can be
               described as low-rank mixed states. We use experimental data and
               simulations to show how the reconstruction technique compensates
               for and characterizes various sources of decoherence
               quantitatively. Based on ptychography7,8, the procedure is
               closely related to quantum state tomography and is equally

               stringent experimental conditions in ptychography can be
               relaxed, and susceptibility to imaging artefacts is reduced.
               Furthermore, the method yields high-resolution images of mixed
               states within the sample, which may include quantum mixtures or
               fast stationary stochastic processes such as vibrations,

                   thin diffuser (i.e., a scattering lens) in between the
                   sample and the objective lens to modulate the complex light
                   waves from the object. The otherwise inaccessible
                   high-resolution object information can thus be encoded into
                   the captured images. We scan the diffuser to different
                   positions and acquire the corresponding images. A
                   ptychographic phase retrieval process is then used to
                   jointly recover the complex object, the unknown diffuser
                   profile, and the defocus coherent transfer function of the
                   system. Unlike the illumination-based super-resolution
                   approach, the recovered image of our approach depends upon
                   how the complex wavefront exits the sample - not enters it.
                   Therefore, the sample thickness becomes irrelevant during
                   reconstruction. After recovery, we can propagate the
                   super-resolution complex wavefront to any plane along the
                   optical axis. We validate our approach using a resolution
                   target, a quantitative phase target, and biological samples.
                   We demonstrate a 4.5-fold resolution gain over the

                   gain can be achieved with as few as 30 images. The reported
                   approach may provide a quantitative super-resolution

                   of transparent samples with minimal hardware requirements.
                   Intensity images are captured with different source patterns
                   and a non-linear phase retrieval optimization reconstructs
                   the image. The non-linear nature of the processing makes
                   optimizing the illumination pattern designs complicated.
                   Traditional techniques for experimental design (e.g.
                   condition number optimization, spectral analysis) consider
                   only linear measurement formation models and linear
                   reconstructions. Deep neural networks (DNNs) can efficiently
                   represent the non-linear process and can be optimized over
                   via training in an end-to-end framework. However, DNNs
                   typically require a large amount of training examples and
                   parameters to properly learn the phase retrieval process,
                   without making use of the known physical models. Here, we
                   aim to use both our knowledge of the physics and the power
                   of machine learning together. We develop a new data-driven
                   approach to optimizing coded-illumination patterns for a LED
                   array microscope for a given phase reconstruction algorithm.
                   Our method incorporates both the physics of the measurement
                   scheme and the non-linearity of the reconstruction algorithm
                   into the design problem. This enables efficient
                   parameterization, which allows us to use only a small number
                   of training examples to learn designs that generalize well
                   in the experimental setting without retraining. We show
                   experimental results for both a well-characterized phase

              increasingly high data rates and volumes. This paper presents a
              new distributed algorithm for solving the ptychographic image
              reconstruction problem based on automatic differentiation. Input
              datasets are subdivided between multiple graphics processing
              units (GPUs); each subset of the problem is then solved either
              entirely independent of other subsets (asynchronously) or through
              sharing gradient information with other GPUs (synchronously). The
              algorithm was evaluated on simulated and real data acquired at
              the Advanced Photon Source, scaling up to 192 GPUs. The
              synchronous variant of our method outperformed an existing
              multi-GPU implementation in terms of accuracy while running at a
              comparable execution time.",

               complex-valued exit wavefront of an object from a set of its
               diffraction pattern magnitudes. Ptychography is one of the most
               popular techniques for sub-30 nanometer imaging as it does not
               suffer from the limitations of typical lens based imaging
               techniques. The object can be reconstructed from the captured
               diffraction patterns using iterative phase retrieval algorithms.
               Over time many algorithms have been proposed for iterative
               reconstruction of the object based on manually derived update
               rules. In this paper, we adapt automatic differentiation
               framework to solve practical and complex ptychographic phase
               retrieval problems and demonstrate its advantages in terms of
               speed, accuracy, adaptability and generalizability across
               different scanning techniques.",
