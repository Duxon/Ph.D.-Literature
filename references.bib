  abstract  = "Publisher Summary Ptychography is a nonholographic solution of
               the phase problem. It is a method for calculating the phase
               relationships among different parts of a scattered wave
               disturbance in a situation where only the magnitude (intensity
               or flux) of the wave can be physically measured. Its usefulness
               lies in its ability (like holography) to obtain images without
               the use of lenses, and hence to lead to resolution improvements
               and access to properties of the scattering medium that cannot be
               easily obtained from conventional imaging methods. The chapter
               discusses ptychography in the context of other phase-retrieval
               methods in both historical and conceptual terms. In an original
               and oblique approach to the phase problem, it was Hoppe who
               proposed the first version of the particular solution to the
               phase problem. The word ``ptychography'' was introduced to
               suggest a solution to the phase problem using the convolution
               theorem, or rather the ``folding'' of diffraction orders into
               one another via the convolution of the Fourier transform of a
               localized aperture or illumination function in the object plane.
               Apart from computers, the two most important experimental issues
               that affect ptychography, relate to the degree of coherence in
               the illuminating beam and the detector efficiency and dynamic
               range.",

               over and comprehensive characterization of wave fields. As
               reflected in its name, coherent diffractive imaging relies on
               high coherence when reconstructing highly resolved images from
               diffraction intensities alone without the need for image-forming
               lenses1,2,3. Fully coherent light can be described adequately by
               a single pure state. Yet partial coherence and imperfect
               detection often need to be accounted for, requiring statistical
               optics or the superposition of states4,5. Furthermore, the
               dynamics of samples are increasingly the very objectives of
               experiments6. Here we provide a general analytic approach to the
               characterization of diffractive imaging systems that can be
               described as low-rank mixed states. We use experimental data and
               simulations to show how the reconstruction technique compensates
               for and characterizes various sources of decoherence
               quantitatively. Based on ptychography7,8, the procedure is
               closely related to quantum state tomography and is equally

               stringent experimental conditions in ptychography can be
               relaxed, and susceptibility to imaging artefacts is reduced.
               Furthermore, the method yields high-resolution images of mixed
               states within the sample, which may include quantum mixtures or
               fast stationary stochastic processes such as vibrations,

               designed such that the voxel values of the refractive index of
               the 3D object are the variables that are adapted during the
               training process. We demonstrate the method experimentally by
               forming images of the 3D refractive index distribution of Hela
               cells.",

                   employing deep neural network architectures that has
                   significantly advanced the state-of-the-art in computer
                   vision, speech recognition, natural language processing and
                   other domains. In November 2015, Google released
                   $\textit\{TensorFlow\}$, an open source deep learning
                   software library for defining, training and deploying
                   machine learning models. In this paper, we review TensorFlow
                   and put it in context of modern deep learning concepts and
                   software. We discuss its basic computational paradigms and
                   distributed execution model, its programming interface as
                   well as accompanying visualization toolkits. We then compare
                   TensorFlow to alternative libraries such as Theano, Torch or
                   Caffe on a qualitative as well as quantitative basis and
                   finally comment on observed use-cases of TensorFlow in
                   academia and industry.",
